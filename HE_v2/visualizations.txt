List of Current Visualizations
------------------------------

The Visualizations can be accessed starting from your root Human Ecosystems installation.
For example, in my local machine, i reach them at:

http://localhost:8888/HE_v2/visualizations

and then I click on one of the links to see the corresponding visualization.





------------------------------
To Add a new Visualization
------------------------------

Create a unique folder under "visualizations".
Add an "index.html" OR "index.php" file to that folder, which shows your visualization.
Make the folder independent: add into the folder everything which is needed for the visualization (javascripts, css, libraries, images...).
Do not use absolute paths: for all links and file references, use relative paths.
Do not use a specific [research_code], accept the [research_code] as a parameter to your visualization.
Include in the folder a "screenshot.png" file, of preferably 400x200 pixels (it will be scaled in that way, anyway, so you might want to prepare it that way).
From the visualizations you may use one or more of the libraries, files, css, and images which are in the "assets", "css" and "js" sub-folders of the "visualizations" folder.
