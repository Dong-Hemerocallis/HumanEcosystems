HumanEcosystems
===============

Human Ecosystems collects public conversations from social networks in entire cities in order to understand citizensâ€™ thoughts, emotions and relations.  This data is then given back to civil society as an ubiquitous, real-time common, as a real-time source of Open Data which can be used by citizens, administrations, organisations and companies to gain better understandings of society, communities, cultures, and to create innovative services, to organise and to act.
